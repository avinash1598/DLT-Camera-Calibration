# DLT Camera Calibration

This code provides a Python implementation of DLT (Direct Linear Transformation) camera calibration. DLT is a method to estimate the camera parameters (intrinsics and extrinsics) using a set of known world coordinates and their corresponding image coordinates.

# Usage

To use this code, you need to provide a set of known world coordinates and their corresponding image coordinates in a CSV file. The CSV file should have two columns: x,y,z for world coordinates and u,v for image coordinates. The coordinates should be separated by commas and each row should represent a unique point.
